Simplifiers and optimizers

- There are two types of people: people who want simple, foolproof plans, and people who try to do as much as they can. In most cases, the plan of an optimizers turns out to be even better than the plan of a simplifier, but in some cases it goes wrong, and more so than the plans of the simplifier.

Health first

- Concentric circles of priorities: health, money, family, helping others.
- "If you ruin yourself, you won’t be able to work on any other priorities."

Attitude

- It can be changed through good health: sleep, exercise.

Optimize for energy

- It helps getting everything else right.
- Think energy in the short and long term.

News

- In this context, news = WSJ front-page (not Facebook).
- Don't put your head in the sand, but avoid negative news.
- Scan the WSJ home page, and read articles on subjects you're drawn to.
- Use the content to learn about new topics (science, finance…).
- See patterns, make connections between different news.
- All this should leave you more energized.

Finding you talent

- What were you obsessing about before you were 10 years old?
- In which areas did you have a higher than usual tolerance for risk?

Predicting success

- Demand from the start is a good predictor.
- How good the product is from the start doesn't matter.
- For TV, it matters to have a core of enthusiastic fans, more than having a good rating on average.

Praise

- Praise has a transformative power, while criticism has a destructive one.
- Adults are starved for praises.

Conversations

- All you do is introduce yourself and ask questions until you find a point of mutual interest.
- The point of conversation is to make the other person feel good.
- It starts by smiling and keeping your body language open.
- After that, just ask questions and listen as if you cared, all the while looking for common interests.
- It’s a good idea to always have a backlog of stories you can pull out at a moment’s notice

Shyness

- But as with swimming, we can learn to overcome shyness with a little practice.
- Overcoming shyness by imagining you are acting instead of interacting. Literally acting.

Grammar

- People often say “less” when they should say “fewer.”

# Happiness

- Control what you do, and *when* you do it.
- Being able to control the *what* is not enough.
- Ex: a nap will do you no good if the only time you can take is before bedtime.
- Hence the importance of having a job with a flexible schedule.
- The lack of flexibility explains the misery parents with young children experience, even if they otherwise have plenty of resources.

- Happiness has more to do with where we're headed than where we are.
- Sport: good because you see improvements.
- Happiness: health + flexible schedule + expectation of a better future + sleep + diet + exercise.
- Routine: benefit of reducing the number of choices, which can make on tired and reduce happiness.
