# Thomas Piketty - Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013)

- The return of capital is higher than growth, which is the main factor explaining a rise in inequality.
- The more perfect an economy is, the better the system is at giving anyone, independently of their merit, the same level of return on capital, which is the opposite of a meritocratic system.
