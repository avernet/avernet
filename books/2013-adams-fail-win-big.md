# Scott Adams - How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big (2013)

## Energy

### Optimize for energy

- It helps getting everything else right.
- Think energy in the short and long term.

### News as a source of energy

- In this context, news = WSJ front-page (not Facebook).
- Don't put your head in the sand, but avoid negative news.
- Scan the WSJ home page, and read articles on subjects you're drawn to.
- Use the content to learn about new topics (science, finance…).
- See patterns, make connections between different news.
- All this should leave you more energized.

### Finding you talent

- What were you obsessing about before you were 10 years old?
- In which areas did you have a higher than usual tolerance for risk?

### Predicting success

- Demand from the start is a good predictor.
- How good the product is from the start doesn't matter.
- For TV, it matters to have a core of enthusiastic fans, more than having a good rating on average.

## Life skills

### Giving praise

- Praise has a transformative power, while criticism has a destructive one.
- Adults are starved for praises.

### Having conversations

- All you do is introduce yourself and ask questions until you find a point of mutual interest.
- The point of conversation is to make the other person feel good.
- It starts by smiling and keeping your body language open.
- After that, just ask questions and listen as if you cared, all the while looking for common interests.
- It’s a good idea to always have a backlog of stories you can pull out at a moment’s notice

### Handling shyness

- But as with swimming, we can learn to overcome shyness with a little practice.
- Overcoming shyness by imagining you are acting instead of interacting. Literally acting.

### Improving grammar

- People often say “less” when they should say “fewer.”

## Happiness

### Scott's formula

- Health
- Flexible schedule
- Expectation of a better future
- Sleep
- Diet
- Exercise

### Health

- Concentric circles of priorities: health, money, family, helping others.
- "If you ruin yourself, you won’t be able to work on any other priorities."

### Flexible schedule

- Control what you do, and *when* you do it.
- Being able to control the *what* is not enough.
- Ex: a nap will do you no good if the only time you can take is before bedtime.
- Hence the importance of having a job with a flexible schedule.
- The lack of flexibility explains the misery parents with young children experience, even if they otherwise have plenty of resources.

### Expectation of a better future

- Happiness has more to do with where we're headed than where we are.
- Sport: good because you see improvements.
- Routine: benefit of reducing the number of choices, which can make on tired and reduce happiness.

### Diet

- What you eat impacts your level of energy.
- It is hard to see the pattern, as we eat meals composed of many things.
- Declared enemy of energ: simple carbs.
- Pasta is neutral as it scores low on the glycemic index.
- Lack of sleep makes you more hungry than you would normaly be.
- Scott has a mostly vegeterian diet, plus an occasional fish.
- Not against salt and butter.

### Exercise

- Either join a team that sets your exercise schedule, or always follow the same schedule.
- Don't excercise so much in one day that you won't feel like exercising the next day; exercise lightly.
